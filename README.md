<div align='center'> <h2> ELOHIM </h2> </div>

<div align='center'> <h4> We made this web app to be able to quickly add friends to two teams. Mostly made for LAN games but can be used whenever you want to include skill levels of any kind. There's an option to randomize the teams if you prefer or add players to each team manually, but the original idea was to balance the teams by ELO hence the name. </h4> </div> 

<div align='center'> <h2> How Balancing Works </h2> </div> 

<div align='center'> <h4> The code for balancing the teams can be found in elohim.js, it's pretty simple, find the mean and then find every permutation of every team and whichever team when added up is closest to the mean will be one team. </h4> </div>
